# Getting Started

- [dogechain.dog](https://dogechain.dog/) - A general introduction to DogeChain.
- [explorer.dogechain.dog](https://explorer.dogechain.dog/) - DogeChain explorer based on BlockScout

# Whitepaper

Dogechain is an EVM-compatible blockchain that aims to complement the original Dogecoin cryptocurrency. As a proof-of-stake blockchain, Dogechain seeks to bring scalability, security, robustness, and utility to Dogecoin. In short, Dogechain doesn‚Äôt compete with Dogecoin.
Instead, it aims to harmonize with the original meme crypto and enhance it with smart contract capability.

Below is a copy of the original whitepaper:
